1
00:00:07,465 --> 00:00:08,966
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,595
You look cute in bubbles.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,472
Ahh, you're just all liquored up.

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,437
Hey, it's me. I'm coming in.

5
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,946
I've had a very long, hard day.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,073
Want some chicken?

7
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,325
No, thanks. No chicken. Bye-bye.

8
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,705
You sure?
Some extra-crispy, dirty rice?

9
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:42,291
For the last time, no!
Get out, Joey!

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,876
All right.

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,923
Are you okay? He wouldn't leave.

12
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,634
He kept asking me if I wanted chicken.

13
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,094
Chicken?

14
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,014
I could eat some chicken.

15
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,975
Hey, Joe!

16
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,398
Could I get a, uh, three-piece,
some coleslaw, some beans and a Coke?

17
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,942
Aah! Diet Coke.

18
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,361
- Hey.
- Hey.

19
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,239
- Morning, Pheebs.
- I have to tell you this story.

20
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,741
I was coming over
and this cabdriver...

21
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,034
Was his name Angus?

22
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,745
What?

23
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,206
He was a cabdriver
we had in London.

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,999
Oh. Ha, ha, ha.

25
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,876
All right. Anyway...

26
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,379
What was that pub he took us to?

27
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,797
The Wheat Sheaf!

28
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,590
And they had that beer...

29
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,969
- Boddington's.
- Boddington's.

30
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,806
Ooh, uh,
Pheebs was going to tell a story.

31
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,725
So he had a really funny hat.

32
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,270
I don't want to talk about it.

33
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,857
- Hey.
- Hey, Ross!

34
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,025
Boddington's!

35
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,735
Oh, man!

36
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,199
I'd walk back to London for another
frosty one of those bad boys.

37
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,494
They have them at the
British pub by the Trade Center.

38
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,163
Later!

39
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,748
Shouldn't Rachel be back?

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,500
Her plane got delayed.

41
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,544
But she should be here by now.

42
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,505
So you talked to her?
Did she sound mad?

43
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,674
No. But she likes me.

44
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,760
You abandoned her
on a plane to Greece.

45
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,889
I did not "abandon" Rachel. Okay?

46
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,016
Emily showed up at the airport.

47
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,311
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.

48
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:10,022
She's my wife. Rachel is my wife.

49
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,440
Emily!

50
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,028
Emily is my wife.

51
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,572
Man, what is that?

52
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,491
You haven't heard from Emily?

53
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,785
Not since I lost her at the airport.

54
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,038
I can't believe she can outrun you.

55
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,749
Hey! She's fast, okay?

56
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,961
You think you can beat me?
Let's go! Outside!

57
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,465
Hi!

58
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,175
Hi! Rachel!

59
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,972
Rach, I am so sorry.
I am so, so sorry.

60
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,767
Come on.
You just did what you had to do.

61
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,102
Hi, Pheebs.

62
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,648
That's it? You're not mad?
It must've been terrible.

63
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,942
Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece!

64
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,863
There was a nice hotel, nice beach,
met the nice people.

65
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,324
It's not too shabby for Rachel.

66
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,037
So, what, that's it?

67
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,333
Well, yeah. We're cool. Totally cool.

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,835
Thanks, Rach. You're the best.

69
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,380
Oh, no. You're the best.

70
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,467
Oh, I got to go to the flower store.

71
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,054
No one will tell me where Emily is...

72
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,392
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.

73
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,561
One for each day
I've known and loved her.

74
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,397
That should get her talking.

75
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,985
When you make out the card,
be sure to make it out to "Emily."

76
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,409
It's good that you had
such a good time in Greece.

77
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,786
What?

78
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,707
I didn't have a good time in Greece!

79
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,668
Ross abandoned me!

80
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:59,089
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!

81
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,261
People came up to me going,
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"

82
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,973
I mean, it was so humiliating!

83
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,309
I felt like such an idiot!

84
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,811
It's all my fault. You know why?

85
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,440
Because I make very bad decisions.

86
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,858
Oh, that's not true.

87
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,570
Yes, it is true.
I went after Ross in stupid London!

88
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,614
London is stupid! Stupid!

89
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,076
I should've never gone to London.

90
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,997
From now on, you make
all my decisions for me.

91
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,750
Oh, no.
I did that for someone once.

92
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:38,920
I'm not comfortable having
that power over someone's life.

93
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,547
I'll do it.

94
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,552
Fine. Monica, you are now
in charge of my love life.

95
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,513
Okay. I got to go to work.

96
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,193
And, uh, Rachel, great to have you back.

97
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,324
Pheebs!

98
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,831
Always a pleasure.

99
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,842
Rachel? Sweetie, look.

100
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,512
Here's a cute picture of you and Joey.

101
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,013
He's married.

102
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,100
Ross is married. I still can't believe it.

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,061
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.

104
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,438
I'll just have to accept it.

105
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,273
I mean, it's my fault.

106
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,943
Edges! Fingers! Smudgy!

107
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,112
Oh, my God!

108
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:53,203
That's okay. I know that
you're very upset right now.

109
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,163
I know that wasn't about me.

110
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,499
I bet it was about her a little.

111
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,252
If you'd stop thinking about Ross...

112
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,338
...you'd notice there are
great guys everywhere.

113
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,673
Look. Gunther.

114
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,177
He's nice. He's cute.

115
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,721
Yeah. I guess Gunther is...

116
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,974
What about that guy over there?

117
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,019
That's the guy
you flirted with at the counter.

118
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,314
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

119
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,649
You're going to talk to him.

120
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,445
I make your decisions,
and I say you're going to talk to him.

121
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,572
All right.

122
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,950
You're the boss.
I got to do what you tell me.

123
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,411
Say that to him, and you're golden.

124
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,125
- Hey.
- Hey.

125
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,378
Hey, Pheebs.
We got our pictures back from London.

126
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,298
Here's all of us
at the Tower of London...

127
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,383
Here we all are.

128
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,386
There's Ross and Joey and you and...

129
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,972
And me.

130
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,059
We've been talking about
London too much.

131
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,354
Sorry, it's just because
I couldn't be there.

132
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,066
All I get to do now is pregnant stuff.
It bums me out.

133
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,776
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

134
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,906
- What happened?
- A little of this, a little of that.

135
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,824
I got myself a date tomorrow.

136
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:17,078
See? Didn't I tell you?
You're getting over Ross already.

137
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,706
Get out.

138
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,765
What took so long?

139
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,310
I got caught up at work.
But I'm quitting tomorrow.

140
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,567
So thanks for having me over.

141
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,279
Rach...

142
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,577
Pheebs...

143
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,087
See you, man.

144
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,883
What the hell was that?

145
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:16,721
Probably some European
goodbye thing he picked up in London.

146
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,557
That's not European.

147
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,976
It felt French.

148
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,983
I really had a good time.

149
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,609
Yeah, me too.

150
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,904
- So...
- So...

151
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,239
I guess this is it.

152
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,032
Yeah, um...

153
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,828
- Unless you want to come inside?
- Yeah!

154
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:45,250
Oh, uh, wait a minute. You know what?
I can't decide this.

155
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,588
Okay. Just hold on a second.

156
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,634
Um, hi.

157
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,094
Hi.

158
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,638
Where's Monica?
I have to ask her something.

159
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,265
Doing her laundry.

160
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,100
What's that?

161
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,978
It came in the mail today.

162
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,732
It's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.

163
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,860
One for each day
I've known and loved Emily...

164
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,237
...cut up into mulch.

165
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,991
Honey, that's awful.

166
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,118
It's not so bad.

167
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,704
Monica's going to make potpourri.

168
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:30,211
I think I'm going to go
wander out in the rain for a while.

169
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,463
It's not raining.

170
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,215
I can't catch a break.

171
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,887
You're not going anywhere.
Sit right here.

172
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,223
I'll make you some tea
and we'll talk this out.

173
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,558
All right?

174
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,769
Okay.

175
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,563
- Hey, Dave.
- Yeah.

176
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:53,401
Um, I need to take a rain check.
My roommate is really sick.

177
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,653
Okay. Bye.

178
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,866
Honey, listen.

179
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,745
I know things seem so bad...

180
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,289
...and that they won't get any...

181
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,375
Could I talk to you?

182
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,378
I dropped some socks.

183
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:13,672
Yeah.

184
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,767
What is the matter with you?
Do you want to fall into the trap?

185
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:28,812
You did not drop any socks!

186
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,189
I saw Dave, and he said
you blew him off!

187
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,482
You listen to me!

188
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,569
I'm calling the shots!
I say you leave Ross and go get Dave.

189
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,946
What are you doing?

190
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:42,158
Well, ultimately I was trying,
you know, I wanted...

191
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,620
...to tell him that
I'm still in love with him.

192
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,998
What? You cannot tell him that!

193
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,583
Why? Why not?

194
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,877
People love to hear that!

195
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,589
I make the decisions and I say no!

196
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,427
You know what? No, you don't
make my decisions, because...

197
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,095
...you're fired.

198
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,097
You can't fire me.

199
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:08,852
I make your decisions,
and I say I'm not fired. Ha!

200
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,272
Well...

201
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,992
Rachel! Come on, let me in!

202
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,744
Having some trouble?

203
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,288
Rachel locked the door.

204
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,499
I'll kick that door in
if you give me some sugar.

205
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,715
Rachel! Let me in!

206
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:47,974
Thank you.

207
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,521
Rachel? Can I talk to you
outside for a sec?

208
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,148
No.

209
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,942
We really need to talk.

210
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,652
Well, then talk.

211
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,946
Okay, I will.

212
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,702
Remember that thing we just discussed
that you wanted to do?

213
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,120
Yes.

214
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,497
What thing?

215
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,753
Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.

216
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,923
Which I think is a really stupid idea.

217
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,259
It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.

218
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,513
And who knows who she might
end up hurting?

219
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:36,231
Monica's right.
Swing dancing can be tricky.

220
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,609
I have to use the phone.

221
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,780
I got to cancel those five, giant
teddy bears I sent to Emily.

222
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,491
My God. Think of the massacre.

223
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,785
I'm going to do it.

224
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,829
I know you think I'm crazy.

225
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,165
But before you tell him,
try to find one person...

226
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,709
...who thinks it's a good idea.
I bet you can't.

227
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,002
Please?

228
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,548
All right. Fine.

229
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,929
Joey! I'm in!

230
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,306
All right. Good deal.

231
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,898
Pheebs! Hey!

232
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:23,361
- Uh, Pheebs?
- Yeah?

233
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,824
Um, you know how you were saying
you didn't get to go to London...

234
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,868
...and you were feeling left out?
- Yeah.

235
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,954
Well, we all felt really bad
about that...

236
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,624
...so we decided to
take a little trip together.

237
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,002
Oh, that's so nice!

238
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,045
How great! Where's the trip?

239
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,799
Well, we thought we would all
go to a picnic...

240
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,887
...in Central Park!
- Central Park?

241
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,264
All of us. All day.

242
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,849
That sucks!

243
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,519
That's not a trip!
I just came from there.

244
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,731
What'll we high-five about
at the stupid park?

245
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,901
It's right by my house. All right!

246
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,698
I'm going home to bask in the
triumph of my Central Park idea.

247
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,951
Hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissy.

248
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,496
I wanted to talk to you about...

249
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,875
...this whole new European thing
you've got going on.

250
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,253
And I need to say
it makes me very uncomfortable...

251
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,964
...and I just, you know, just stop it!

252
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,676
Just bringing some culture
to the group.

253
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,763
That's fine.
Just don't bring it in my mouth.

254
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,265
It makes me want to puke.

255
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,608
Hey, everybody! Pheebs is here!

256
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,696
- Phoebe! Whoo!
- Okay. Whoo! Hi!

257
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:53,660
Pheebs, we decided that
the picnic idea was a little...

258
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,245
It didn't have any... Well, it blew.

259
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:03,211
We thought that this afternoon we'd
all go away for the whole weekend...

260
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,712
...to Atlantic City.

261
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:09,384
Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan!
Whose plan was that?

262
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,677
Mine!

263
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,555
- Wait. It was my plan.
- No...

264
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,141
...I said we needed a new plan.

265
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,394
And I came up with Atlantic City.

266
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,604
Which is the new plan.

267
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,193
Why don't we, um, all
meet upstairs in an hour?

268
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,695
Okay.

269
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,407
I'm going to go pack.
I'm going to go pack my ass off.

270
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,244
Let's go.

271
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,997
You know what?
I'll meet you in a minute.

272
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,167
Rachel, you didn't find anyone,
so you can't tell him.

273
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,503
You know what? That doesn't matter.

274
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,425
Do you know how painful it is
to tell someone you love them...

275
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,468
...and not have them say it back?

276
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,264
I don't care.

277
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,475
Okay...

278
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,811
I can't watch.

279
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,119
What you reading?

280
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,413
Paper.

281
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,498
Yeah? What's it about?

282
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,170
The events from around the globe.

283
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,505
Okay...

284
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:35,011
Uh, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

285
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,888
Everyone's saying I shouldn't.

286
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,016
But I think they're wrong.
People can be wrong.

287
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,934
Once at work...

288
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,729
...I thought carbon dating
is fossilized...

289
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,732
I'm really trying
to tell you something here.

290
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,026
Yeah...

291
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,527
Go ahead.

292
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,239
I think I'm just going to say it.

293
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,908
I'm just going to say it.

294
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,702
Uh...

295
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,087
I'm still in love with you, Ross.

296
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:21,974
Wow, uh...

297
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:23,976
Huh. I'm...

298
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,938
Wow. I'm not sure what to do
with that right now.

299
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,364
What? Was that a joke?
Because it's mean.

300
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,327
I'm so dead serious.

301
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,412
I'm totally serious.

302
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,956
Why are you laughing?

303
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,585
Because I just heard it!

304
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,879
I heard it! And it's ridiculous!

305
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,256
I mean...

306
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,715
You're married!

307
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,426
You're married, and it's just ridiculous.

308
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,180
When I said it, I sort of
floated up out of my body.

309
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:06,144
And then I heard myself say it,
and then the floating Rachel...

310
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,275
I was like, "You are such an idiot!"

311
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,948
- Well, I am married.
- I know.

312
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,743
Though I haven't spoken to her
since the wedding.

313
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,457
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

314
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,920
Actually, it kind of is.

315
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,717
My wife won't return my calls.

316
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,264
I don't know where my wife is.

317
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,729
"Hey, Ross! Where's the missus?"
"Don't know!"

318
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,357
Oh, God.

319
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,652
Okay.

320
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,448
You know what?
Could you forget I told you this?

321
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,243
Well, I kind of have to.

322
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,287
Because the thing is...

323
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,249
The thing is, you know,
that you're married to Emily.

324
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,921
That is what the thing is.

325
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,843
Oh, God.

326
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:26,015
Things won't be weird between us, right?
Was that stupid?

327
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,350
Me telling you that?

328
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,977
No, no. I'm glad you did.

329
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,314
If nothing else...

330
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,776
...it's always great when someone
tells you they love you.

331
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,237
That's what I said!

332
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,618
- Thank you for being so nice.
- No. Thank you for...

333
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,955
Thank you.

334
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,501
- Okay, let's go!
- Yeah, Atlantic City!

335
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,127
Come on!

336
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,296
Atlantic City, baby!

337
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,299
Let's roll some bones. Hey, Joey!

338
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,093
High-five for rolling bones.

339
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,386
- Ow!
- Ow!

340
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,388
Oh.

341
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,722
Ooh!

342
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,100
Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking.

343
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,310
Oh, my God. Your water broke.

344
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,396
Oh! Okay!

345
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,148
Well, don't worry. I call shotgun.

346
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,528
Pheebs, we have to take you
to the hospital now.

347
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,407
Pheebs, the babies are coming now.

348
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,159
Honey! High-five!
The babies are coming!

349
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,703
Whoo!

350
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,205
Remember when my water broke?

351
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,380
Phoebe's going to have her babies.

352
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,882
I know.
It's beautiful and amazing.

353
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:53,144
I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left the room.

354
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,564
It's too bad they didn't
see us having sex.

355
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,275
Do you know anything about women?

356
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,569
No.

357
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,362
- It's all right.
- Okay.
